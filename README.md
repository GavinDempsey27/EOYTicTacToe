# EOYTicTacToe
EOY Project Plan

What are we making?
Tic Tac Toe game in Java

Resources:
Something that can program with Java - IntelliJ
Scanner class

Risks/Assumptions:
If I want a GUI, I donâ€™t know how to implement that, research into that
If I run into errors, I have a hard time understanding what's wrong sometimes
Overall not super proficient in implementing whole programs

Specs:
Prints a 3x3 board
Takes input from 2 players
Stores players inputs
Places players inputs onto board
Reprints board
Check if win/lose/tie

Timeline:
May 12: Due date of plan
May 19: 1st prototype - 3x3 board, scanner for 2 inputs, maybe start looking at possible GUI?
May 26: 2nd prototype - conditions for winner/loser/tie, print statements for certain situations
May 26 - June 9: final touches, clean up code if possible - turn in
